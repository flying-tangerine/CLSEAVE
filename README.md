# ClipCoTea

### In the CLIP_VE folder, use main.py for training and main_evaluate.py for evaluation. Change image_folder to your Flickr30k file path, and change the path of the SNLI-VE dataset. Also, change the CLIP-VE model path and the transferred model path in main_evaluate.py during evaluation.

### In the clseave folder, we built the clseave training method based on CliCoTEA. It includes the SNLI-VE translation scripts, extracting word alignment pair scripts, and training embedding alignment for new language model scripts. Please provide different values in the command line according to their bash files.
